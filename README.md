# CS238
MDPs for microgrids

Things to try

* [ ] Change CONSUMER_CONSUMPTION and/or PRODUCER_PRODUCTION
* [ ] Change MIN_UNIT and/or MAX_UNIT
* [ ] Change Reward
* [ ] Change initial state
* [ ] extend to 4x4 grid

if there's time
* [ ] Make CONSUMER_CONSUMPTION and/or PRODUCER_PRODUCTION dependent on the microgrid (not the same for each microgrid)
* [ ] Make price for energy variable with time (e.g. introduce extenertal price of energy, which could be dependent on how badly it is needed or a random generator function)
